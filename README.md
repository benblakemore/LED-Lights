# LED-Lights
Implementation of the FastLED library used to control LED strip lights. Hope to build on this by integrating some kind of wifi control

After purchasing ESP015 wi-fi module and connecting to breadboard I experienced voltage issues that I couldn't get to the bottom of. Parking this in the meantime until I have a larger desk space as it was encroaching too much on WFH set-up
